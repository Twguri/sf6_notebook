# SF6 Notebook Roadmap

This document outlines the **planned direction and priorities** for SF6 Notebook.  
The roadmap is intentionally flexible and reflects a *tool-first, player-centric* philosophy rather than a fixed release schedule.

---

## 🎯 Guiding Principles

All roadmap items follow these principles:

- **Local-first**: No mandatory accounts or servers
- **Player utility first**: Features must directly help real match preparation
- **Incremental improvement**: Small, high-impact changes over large rewrites
- **Cross-platform friendly**: Web → Desktop → Mobile 

---

## ✅ Current State

- Core notebook workflow (Matchup / Combo / Notes)
- Fighter Input system (Normal / Fighter modes)
- Local storage with export/import
- Frame data reference (partial)
- Bilingual UI (EN / 中文)
- GitHub Pages deployment

---

## 🚧 Short-Term (Next Iterations)

### 📱 Mobile Usability
- Improve touch target sizing
- Better handling of soft keyboard interactions
- Hide or reposition floating buttons when keyboard is active
- Refine modal behavior on small screens

### ⌨️ Fighter Input Enhancements
- One-tap insertion buttons for common directions and buttons
- Visual indicator for current input mode
- Improved cursor handling in mobile environments

### 📊 Frame Data Expansion
- Fill missing frame data entries
- Improve consistency across characters
- Version-aware notes for frame data changes

---

## 🧪 Mid-Term

### 🌐 PWA Support
- Installable web app (Add to Home Screen)
- Offline access to existing notes
- App icon, splash screen, and theme color polish

### 📦 Data Management
- More granular export/import (per character / per combo group)
- Conflict-safe import behavior
- Optional data backup helpers (still local-first)

### 🎨 UI / UX Refinement
- Better typography scaling for long sessions
- Reduced visual noise in dense views
- Performance optimizations for large note sets

---

## 🚀 Long-Term

### 📱 Native Mobile (Android)
- Android APK via Capacitor
- Better soft keyboard control
- Optional haptic feedback for input actions

### 💻 Desktop Builds
- Windows executable via Tauri
- Native window behavior and shortcuts
- Offline-first desktop experience

---

## ❌ Out of Scope (By Design)

The following are intentionally **not planned**:

- User accounts / login systems
- Cloud sync or centralized servers
- Social features (likes, comments, sharing)
- Monetization or ads

---

## 🤝 Community Input

The roadmap is open to discussion.

If you have ideas that:
- Improve training efficiency
- Simplify combo or matchup workflows
- Enhance mobile usability without adding complexity

Feel free to open an issue and start a discussion.

*SF6 Notebook is built to support how fighting game players actually think, train, and prepare — not to become a platform.*
